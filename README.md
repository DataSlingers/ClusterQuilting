### MosaicPatchSim.R
Create simulated data with mosaic patch observation setting.
### SeqPatchSim.R
Create simulated data with sequential patch observation setting.
### CompMethods
Contains scripts for other comparison incomplete spectral clustering methods. Adapted from code provided by authors of those methods. 
### SpectralClustering.R
